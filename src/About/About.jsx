        The Weldost project was created with the aim of connecting offline and
        online activities in a unique way. Each member of the project has
        experience in different fields, which allows our vision to be realized.
        Thus, providing opportunities in today's world that are not possible
        anywhere else! We created the WMP digital pass primarily for this
        purpose. Which can be used for travel and generates passive income at
        the same time. With this combination, everyone's travel will pay off. We
        believe this is a great opportunity for many people and families, since
        the expenses spent on travel will be covered by us. So our customers can
        even transfer the generated income to a new trip, which will be fully
        paid for from the generated staking income. In the future, we would like
        to develop more offline and online connection options. Building a global
        brand over the years and spreading it around the world through our own
        products. Achieving a strong community to which we can provide as many
        useful services as possible. More information about the Weldost project
        is available by downloading the whitepaper.
