                At Weldost, we are constantly looking for partnerships to help
                and promote each other. We look for such relationships with
                other projects, companies and influencers. If we reach a mutual
                agreement with a new partner, we reward them with a partnership
                invitation. This is an invitation for three days and a maximum
                of six people. In addition, those invited can choose from two
                locations. These locations are located in Mayrhofen, Austria.
                This place offers great relaxation. In addition, a personal
                meeting with members of the Weldost project, where everything
                can be discussed personally. We believe that a good relationship
                between the parties brings everyone forward. If you are
                interested in cooperation, please contact us.
